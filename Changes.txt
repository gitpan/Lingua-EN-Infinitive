1.04 19-Jun-2001
----------------
o Patch outcome of rule 15 so certain monosyllables are treated specially.
	Eg swimming => swim and swimm, not swimme and swimm.
	Thanks to Mike Tsai for drawing this problem to my attention.
	Previous testing had completely overlooked these types of words.
o Researching this problem reveals that, unfortunately, American spelling
	such as traveling => travel is handled correctly but British spelling
	such as travelling => travel is not.
